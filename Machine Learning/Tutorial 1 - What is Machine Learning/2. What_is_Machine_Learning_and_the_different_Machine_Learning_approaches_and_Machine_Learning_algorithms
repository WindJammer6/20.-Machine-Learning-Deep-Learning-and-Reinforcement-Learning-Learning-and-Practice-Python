What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses Machine Learning (ML) 
algorithms trained on datasets to create a Machine Learning (ML) model (represented in a machine)
that are capable of predicting outcomes and classifying information without human intervention. 
It can also be thought as an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows a machine 
to automatically learn and improve from experience (by presenting it with more relevant data).

Machine learning algorithms are used in many computer programs to perform lots of tasks in our daily lives. 
For example, the autocorrect feature on your smartphone makes use of a combination of machine learning 
algorithms and a sub-field of machine learning called Natural Language Processing (NLP), which predicts 
what words you intend to type next.

What is a Machine Learning (ML) model?
Machine Learning (ML) models refer to the contextualised version of Machine Learning (ML) 
algorithm(s). They are what Machine Learning (ML) algorithm(s) become after being sufficiently 
trained, such that it has accumulated a comprehensive list of instructions that allow them to 
function correctly, using a specific dataset.

Examples of ML models are infinite, due to the infinitely possible ways to contextualise ML
algorithms in reality.


What is a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm?
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms refer to the list set of instructions (definition of an 
algorithm) that allows a machine to learn from data and improve from experience, and be capable 
of predicting outcomes and classifying information without human intervention.

Examples of ML algorithms are finite, due to the fact that there is really only a limited set 
of ways/ML algorithms that we know of to train a machine to be capable of predicting outcomes 
and classifying information without human intervention.


(Important note: ML algorithms/models allows a machine to learn from data, but they do not 
                 train the machine to be able to learn from data! These ML algorithms are
                 trained (to become ML models) via another set of algorithms called Optimization
                 Algorithms. 
                
                 You can think of it as ML algorithms/models as the 'template'/'structure' that 
                 a machine uses for learning from data, and Optimization Algorithms are the 'driving 
                 force' behind the training of these ML algorithms. 
                
                 (see more about Optimization Algorithms in the '1. What_are_Optimization_Algorithms_and
                 _Gradient_Descent_Optimization_Algorithm_and_the_Cost_Function.txt' file in the 
                 'Tutorial 4 - Optimization Algorithms, Gradient Descent Optimzation Algorithm and the 
                 Cost Function' folder).

What are the 4 distinct ways/approaches for a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to be trained to become a Machine 
Learning (ML) model?
The 4 distinct ways/approaches a ML algorithm can be trained are:
1. Supervised learning - consists of ML algorithms that are trained using a 'labelled 
                         dataset', where the data contains both the input and desired output 
                         parameters. The ML algorithms in this category can be further split 
                         into 2 sub-categories, Regression Supervised Learning and 
                         Classification Supervised Learning
   a. Regression Supervised Learning - consists of Supervised learning ML algorithms that 
                                       are trained using a 'labeled dataset', where the 
                                       data contains both the input and desired output 
                                       parameters, and that the desired outputs is a 
                                       continuous range of values
   b. Classification Supervised Learning - consists of Supervised learning ML algorithms that 
                                           are trained using a 'labeled dataset', where 
                                           the data contains both the input and desired output 
                                           parameters, and that the desired outputs is a 
                                           limited set of values

2. Unsupervised learning - consists of ML algorithms that are trained using an 'unlabelled 
                           dataset', where the data contains only the input parameters. They
                           primarily aim to discover hidden patterns/similarities/clusters 
                           within the 'unlabelled dataset'. The ML algorithms in this category 
                           can be further split into 2 sub-categories, Clustering Unsupervised 
                           Learning and Association Unsupervised Learning
   a. Clustering Unsupervised Learning - consists of Unsupervised learning ML algorithms that 
                                         are trained using an 'unlabeled dataset', where the 
                                         data contains only the input parameters, and that they 
                                         train the machine to group data based on their 
                                         similarity into clusters
   b. Association Unsupervised Learning - consists of Unsupervised learning ML algorithms that 
                                          are trained using an 'unlabeled dataset', where 
                                          the data contains only the input parameters, and that 
                                          they train the machine to discover relationships 
                                          between data

3. Semi-supervised learning - consists of ML algorithms that are trained using both 'labelled 
                              dataset' and 'unlabelled dataset', kind of like working in between 
                              Supervised and Unsupervised learning. 

4. Reinforcement learning - consists of ML algorithms that are trained not using datasets, 
                            but rather, they involve the machine (autonomous agent) interacting in an 
                            environment, and training the machine by allowing it to receive feedback in the 
                            form of rewards or penalties in that environment

        ways/approaches of training a machine to be able to be capable of predicting outcomes and 
        classifying information without human intervention. They are so powerful, such that there
        is an entire field of study about (artificial) Neural Networks, particularly on 'deep' 
        (artificial) Neural Networks, known as Deep Learning (DL).
      - As you can see, these Machine Learning (ML) tutorials mainly focuses on the more common 
        Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning ML algorithms. This is because these ML 
        algorithms are more foundational, and less complex, allowing for a smoother transaction 
        to understanding Machine Learning (ML) concepts in the topic of Machine Learning (ML), 
        for someone starting out on the topic of Machine Learning (ML) like me.

Linear vs Non-Linear Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, and why can some Machine Learning (ML) algorithms be 
represented by a single mathematical equation, but some cannot? 

Furthermore, ML algorithms can be further split into linear or non-linear by nature. Specific explanation on
why each ML algorithm is linear, or non-linear is too tedious, and complex for the more advanced ML 
algorithms (though the explanation for the linear or non-linear nature for some of these ML algorithms is in 
these tutorials).

- Linear ML algorithms are where the relationship or decision boundary between the independent variables/features 
  (inputs) and dependent variable (output) is proportional. They can be represented by a single mathematical 
  equation.
- Non-linear ML algorithms are where the relationship (for Regression problems) or decision boundary (for 
  Classification problems) between the independent variables/features (inputs) and dependent variable (output) is 
  more complex and flexible. They cannot be represented by a single mathematical equation, rather, they can be 
  thought to be associated to multiple, more complex mathematical equations (but no single mathematical equation 
  can be said to represent these ML algorithms).

(Note: 
-> The clear distinction between linearity or non-linearity by nature is more associated for Supervised Learning 
   ML algorithms, while this distinction between linearity or non-linearity by nature blurs for Unsupervised 
   Learning ML algorithms.
-> Non-linear ML algorithms can exhibit linear behaviour in specific context/patterns/datasets, but linear ML
   algorithms is more of 'fixed' in its linear behaviour, and cannot exhibit non-linear behaviour.
