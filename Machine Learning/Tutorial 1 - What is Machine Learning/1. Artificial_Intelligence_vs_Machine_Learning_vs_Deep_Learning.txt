What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a machine to imitate human intelligence.

A common misconception that people have about AI is that these AI machines can understand, 
think, or reason. However, AI is only trained to be really good at a particular thing we optimize 
it for, so it has a very specific type of â€œintelligence", while human intelligence is more general.

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) = Data + Algorithms



What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses Machine Learning (ML) 
algorithms trained on datasets to create a Machine Learning (ML) model (represented in a machine)
that are capable of predicting outcomes and classifying information without human intervention. 
It can also be thought as an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows a machine 
to automatically learn and improve from experience (by presenting it with more relevant data).

Machine Learning algorithms are used to train computers to perform lots of tasks in our daily lives. 
For example, the autocorrect feature on your smartphone is a kind of machine Learning called Natural 
Language Processing (NLP), which predicts what words you intend to type next.



What is Deep Learning (DL)? 
Deep Learning (DL) is a subfield of Machine Learning (ML), where the focused Machine Learning (ML) 
algorithm trained on datasets to create a Deep Learning (DL) model (represented in a machine), is 
(artificial) Neural Networks, specifically, (artificial) Neural Networks that are 'deep', containing
multiple hidden layers. 

This is because (artificial) Neural Networks is a ML algorithm, hence not all models created by 
(artificial) Neural Networks are DL models, only models created by 'deep' (artificial) neural 
networks are considered DL models, while models created by 'shallow' (artificial) Neural Networks 
(containing only a few hidden layers), remain as ML models. You can think of Deep Learning (DL)
being a field of study on (artificial) Neural Networks, particularly on 'deep' (artificial) Neural 
Networks. 

An (artificial) Neural Network is an interconnected group of nodes, an attempt to mimic to the 
vast network of neurons in a brain. There are various subtypes of the (artificial) Neural Network
ML algorithm, but we will explore that in a Deep Learning tutorial in the future.

Machine Learning (ML) models  vs  Machine Learning (ML) algorithms

Definition of Machine Learning (ML) models and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms
- ML models refer to the contextualised version of ML algorithm(s). They are what ML algorithm(s) 
  become after being sufficiently trained, such that it has accumulated a comprehensive list of 
  instructions that allow them to function correctly, using a specific dataset.
- ML algorithms refer to the list set of instructions (definition of an algorithm) to train a
  machine to be able to be capable of predicting outcomes and classifying information without 
  human intervention.

Diversity of Machine Learning (ML) models and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms
- Examples of ML models are infinite, due to the infinitely possible ways to contextualise ML
  algorithms in reality.
- Examples of ML algorithms are finite, due to the fact that there is really only a limited set 
  of ways/ML algorithms that we know of to train a machine to be capable of predicting outcomes 
  and classifying information without human intervention (e.g. Linear Regression, Decision trees,
  (artificial) Neural Networks etc.).

Comparing Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning:
An easier way to compare Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning is 
through knowing which is the subset of which (the arrow indicates 'is a superset of'):

    Aritificial Intelligence (AI) -> Machine Learning (ML) -> Deep Learning (-> Generative AI)
