# Since Sigmoid is S shaped 2D graph...then for softmax...
# Apparently its hard to draw the softmax function in a 2D graph? Due to the presense of more than 2 classes? Not super sure how
# it works maybe its cuz of it it needs more axis, and will be 3D graph and above alr...? So how will it look like tho?
