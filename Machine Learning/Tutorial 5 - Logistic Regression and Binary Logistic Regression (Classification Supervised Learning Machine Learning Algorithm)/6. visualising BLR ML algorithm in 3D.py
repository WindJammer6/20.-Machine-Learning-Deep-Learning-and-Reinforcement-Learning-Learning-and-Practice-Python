# For 2 independent variables (3D) the logistic regression will be a sigmoid surface (you can google this for visualisation), for 1 independent variable (2D) the logistic regression regression will be the regular sigmoid curve

# Oh cool chatgpt managed to implement matplotlib to plot 3D 

# But unfortunately it obv can't plot 4d since it's we are living in 3d world and can't perceive 4d


# Things to do:
# show the plotting of the 3d graph for multiple features LR


# change the dataset name of the bought insurance one to include binary categorical variables
# and the employee csv dataset also to include binary categorical variables also!



# In this tutorial only doing LR with 1 independent variable (so representation of the sigmoid function is easier. 
# But it works for datasets with multiple independent varuables... but it looks 3d grph instead lor)
