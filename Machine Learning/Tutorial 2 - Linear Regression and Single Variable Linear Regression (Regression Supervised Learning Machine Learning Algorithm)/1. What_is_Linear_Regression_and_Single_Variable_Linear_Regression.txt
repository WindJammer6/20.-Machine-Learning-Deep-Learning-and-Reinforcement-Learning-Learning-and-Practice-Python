What is Linear Regression (LR)?
LR is a type of Supervised learning Regression Machine Learning (ML) algorithm that computes the 
linear relationship between a dependent variable and at least one independent variable/feature.

Types of Linear Regression (LR):
1. Single Variable Linear Regression (SVLR) (will be covered in this tutorial)
2. Multiple Variable Linear Regression (MVLR) (will be covered in 'Tutorial 2.1 - Multiple Variable 
                                               Linear Regression (Regression Supervised Learning Machine
                                               Learning Algorithm)')

What is Single Variable Linear Regression (SVLR)?
SVLR is a type of Supervised learning Regression Machine Learning (ML) algorithm that computes the 
linear relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable/feature.

Note: In the topic of ML, independent variables are also commonly called 'features'.

How does the Single Variable Linear Regression (SVLR) Machine Learning (ML) algorithm work?
The SVLR ML algorithm can be essentially represented by the mathematical equation:
        y = mx + b

where,
- 'y' is the dependent variable
- 'x' is the independent variable/feature
- 'm' is the gradient/coefficient of the independent variable/feature 'x'
- 'b' is the y-intercept, 'constant term'

How does the Single Variable Linear Regression (SVLR) ML algorithm work in a context:
Lets say we have a dataset (a table of data) of 'housing prices' and just one variable affecting the 'housing 
prices', the 'house area' (dataset is referenced from 'house_prices_with_one_independent_variable.csv'), and 
we plotted the data from this dataset in a scatter graph (as shown below), and drew a best fit line through 
the data (points) in the scatter graph with minimal error (Mean Square Error) between the best fit line and 
all the data (points) in the scatter graph.

        | /
      0 |-------------> area (m^2)
        0        4000

The mathematical equation for the SVLR ML algorithm in this context, aka the Machine Learning (ML) model for this 
context, is:
        price = m * area + b

where,
- 'price' ('y') is the dependent variable
- 'area' ('x') is the independent variable/feature
- 'm' is the gradient/coefficient of 'area' ('x')
- 'b' is the y-intercept, 'constant term'

The mathematical equation, 'y = mx + b', basically represents the SVLR ML algorithm, while the best fit line and 
the mathematical equation, 'price = m * area + b', basically represents this context's SVLR ML algorithm.

So, how is the Single Variable Linear Regression (SVLR) a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm in this context?
The SVLR is a ML algorithm because its algorithm allows it to make predictions. 

In this context, looking at the best fit line drawn in the scatter graph using the mathematical equation using the 
data from the dataset of the 'housing prices' and its only independent variable/feature, 'house area', we can 
predict, for example, the estimate price of a potentially bigger house of larger 'house area', lets say 4000m^2, 
that to be $12000, even though this 'potentially bigger house' might not exist yet.

Or you can think of it as substituting the value of the 'house area' independent variable/feature into the 
mathematical equation for the SVLR ML algorithm in this context, aka the SVLR ML model for this context, 
'price = m * area + b', to find the predicted 'housing price' dependent variable.
