What is Multiple Variable Linear Regression (MVLR)?
MVLR is a type of Supervised learning Regression Machine Learning (ML) algorithm that computes the linear relationship 
between a dependent variable and more than one independent variables/features.

Note: In the topic of Machine Learning, independent variables are also commonly called 'features'.

How does the Multiple Variable Linear Regression (MVLR) Machine Learning (ML) algorithm work?
The MVLR ML algorithm can be essentially represented by the mathematical equation:
        y = m1*x1 + m2*x2 + m3*x3 + ... + m?*x? + b

(Note: The '...' represents that there can any number of independent variables/features in the MVLR ML algorithm)

where,
- 'y' is the dependent variable
- 'x1', 'x2', 'x3' and 'x?' are the independent variables/features
- 'm1', 'm2', 'm3' and 'm?' are the gradients/coefficients of the independent variables/features 'x1', 'x2', 'x3' and 'x?' 
  respectively
- 'b' is the intercept (Note: For the MVLR ML algorithm, 'b' does not represent the y-intercept! I will not explain why 
  and what exactly it is here, but to simplify things, just know that it is basically just a 'constant term')

Trouble of representing the Multiple Variable Linear Regression (MVLR) ML algorithm graphically compared to the 
Single Variable Linear Regression (SVLR) ML algorithm:
Fundamentally, the MVLR ML algorithm works exactly the same way as the SVLR ML algorithm (see the 
'1. What_is_Linear_Regression_and_Single_Variable_Linear_Regression.txt' file in the 'Tutorial 2 - Linear Regression and 
Single Variable Linear Regression (Regression Supervised Learning Machine Learning Algorithm)' folder), in the sense that 
they are both essentially the best fit line through the data (points) in a scatter graph with minimal error (Mean Square 
Error) between the best fit line and all the data (points) in the scatter graph. 

The mathematical equation that represents the SVLR ML algorithm is 'y = mx + c', hence we can show the best fit line (the 
SVLR ML algorithm itself) in a 2D graph. However, the mathematical equation that represents the MVLR ML algorithm is 
'y = m1*x1 + m2*x2 + m3*x3 + ... + m?*x? + b', hence the best fit line (the MVLR ML algorithm itself) is difficult to show 
as it will require a higher dimension graph (e.g. 3D, 4D...), with the number of dimensions depending on the number of 
independent variables/features involved in the MVLR ML algorithm. You can also to think of it as the data (points) that the 
best fit line (the MVLR ML algorithm itself) will also be in a higher dimensional graph, because there is more than just 
'y' and 'x1' coordinates, but 'x2', 'x3', ... 'x?' and so on for each data (point), resulting in the best fit line (the 
MVLR ML algorithm itself) through these higher dimensional data (points) to also be in a higher dimensional graph.

Regardless, we can still show how the MVLR ML algorithm works using its mathematical equation, 
'y = m1*x1 + m2*x2 + m3*x3 + ... + m?*x? + b'.

How does the Multiple Variable Linear Regression (MVLR) ML algorithm work in a context:
Lets say we have a dataset (a table of data) of 'housing prices' and 3 (multiple) variables affecting the 'housing 
prices', the 'house area', 'number of bedrooms' and 'house age'. (We cannot plot the best fit line for visualisation,
which represents the MVLR ML algorithm itself as explained in the above section 'Trouble of representing the MVLR ML 
algorithm graphically compared to the SVLR ML algorithm')

The mathematical equation for the MVLR ML algorithm in this context, aka the Machine 
Learning (ML) model for this context, is:
        price = m1*area + m2*bedroom + m3*age + b

where,
- 'price' ('y') is the dependent variable
- 'area' ('x1'), 'bedroom' ('x2') and 'age' ('x3') are the independent variables/features
- 'm1', 'm2' and 'm3' are the gradient/coefficient of the independent variables/features 'area' ('x1'), 'bedroom' 
  ('x2') and 'age' ('x3') respectively
- 'b' is the intercept (Note: For the MVLR ML algorithm, 'b' does not represent the y-intercept! I will not explain why 
  and what exactly it is here, but to simplify things, just know that it is basically just a 'constant term')

The mathematical equation, 'y = m1*x1 + m2*x2 + m3*x3 + ... + m?*x? + b', basically represents the MVLR ML algorithm, while 
the mathematical equation, 'price = m1*area + m2*bedroom + m3*age + b', basically represents this context's MVLR ML 
algorithm.

So, how is the Multiple Variable Linear Regression (MVLR) a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm in this context?
The MVLR is a ML algorithm because its algorithm allows it to make predictions. 

(We cannot plot the best fit line for visualisation, which represents the MVLR ML algorithm itself as explained in the 
above section 'Trouble of representing the MVLR ML algorithm graphically compared to the SVLR ML algorithm')

You can think of it as substituting the value of the 'house area', 'number of bedrooms' and 'house age' independent 
variables/features into the mathematical equation for the MVLR ML algorithm in this context, aka the MVLR ML model 
for this context, 'price = m1*area + m2*bedroom + m3*age + b', to find the predicted 'housing price' dependent 
variable.
