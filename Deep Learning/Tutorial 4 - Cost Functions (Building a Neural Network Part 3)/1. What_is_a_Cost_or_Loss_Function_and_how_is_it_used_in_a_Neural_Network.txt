(Recall that we have covered about Loss and Cost Function back in the ML tutorials, under the
'1. What_are_Optimization_Algorithms_and_General_Gradient_Descent_Optimization_Algorithm_and_what_
is_a_Cost_Function_and_Mean_Squared_Error_Cost_Function.txt' file in the 'Tutorial 3 - Optimization 
Algorithms, General Gradient Descent Optimzation Algorithm, Cost Functions and the Mean Squared Error 
(MSE) Cost Function' folder) (This section is copy-pasted from that file)


What is the Cost Function?
The Cost Function is a mathematical function that measures how wrong a Machine Learning (ML) model is, when 
it is finding a relationship between the dependent variable/predicted values by a ML model (output), and 
the independent variables/features/actual values used to train the ML model (input).


What is the difference between the Cost Function and Loss/Error Function?
The terms 'Cost' Function and 'Loss/Error' Function are used interchangably, but both terms do have their distinct
differences. 

- The Loss/Error Function, quantifies the difference between a single actual data point value and a single 
  prediction/data point value of the Machine Learning (ML) model. 
- The Cost Function, quantifies the ML model's overall performance using the average of the Loss/Error Functions of an 
  entire dataset, containing multiple actual data point values, with the multiple prediction/data point values of the 
  Machine Learning (ML) model.

However, in this tutorial, we will be using the the term 'Cost' function as it is more relevant for the context.



What are the different types of Cost Functions?
The type of Cost Function depends on the nature/type of the Machine Learning (ML) problem that it is solving.

(Note: In this tutorial I am not going in-depth to explain every single type of Cost Function as the focus of this
       tutorial is about the (general) Gradient Descent algorithm and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) Cost Function
       only)


Generally, the 2 most common different natures/types of ML problems are:
1. Regression problem                    : involves predicting a continuous output variable (numeric value) based 
                                           on input independent variables/features
2. Classification problem                : involves predicting a discrete label/category based on input independent
                                           variable/features
   a. Binary Classification problem      : involves predicting categorical variables and classifying them into 
                                           1 out of 2 outcomes based on input independent variables/features
   b. Multi-class Classification problem : involves predicting categorical variables and classifying them into 
                                           1 out of more than 2 outcomes based on input independent 
                                           variables/features


Hence, the 2 most common different types of Cost Functions are:
1. Regression Cost Functions
2. Classification Cost Functions
   a. Binary Classification Cost Functions
   b. Multi-class Classification Cost Functions


Types of common Cost Functions that solve each nature/type of ML problem:
1. Regression Cost Functions
   -> Mean Squre Error (MSE) 
      (Formula: MSE = (1/n) * Σᵢ(yᵢ-ŷᵢ)²)
   -> Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 
      (Formula: MAE = (1/n) * Σ|yᵢ-ŷᵢ|)

2. Classification Cost Functions
   a. Binary Classification Cost Functions
      -> Binary Logistic Loss/Binary Cross-Entropy 
         (Formula: BinaryCrossEntropy = -(1/n) * Σ[yᵢ*log(ŷᵢ) + (1-yᵢ) * log(1-ŷᵢ)])
      -> Hinge Loss 
         (Formula: Hinge Loss = (1/n) * Σmax(0, 1-yᵢ*ŷᵢ))

   b. Multi-class Classification Cost Functions
      -> Multi-Class/Categorical Logistic Loss / Multi-Class/Categorical Cross-Entropy 
         (Formula: MultiClassCrossEntropy = -(1/n) * ΣᵢΣⱼ[yᵢⱼ * log(ŷᵢⱼ)])
      -> Sparse Multi-Class/Categorical Logistic Loss / Sparse Multi-Class/Categorical Cross-Entropy
         (Formula: SparseMultiClassCrossEntropy = -(1/n) * Σᵢlog(ŷᵢⱼ))
      -> Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence) 
         (Formula: KLDivergence = ΣᵢΣⱼ[yᵢⱼ * log(yᵢⱼ/ŷᵢⱼ)])

(yᵢ: represents actual data point value | ŷᵢ: represents prediction/data point value | n: represents the number
 of data points)


Note: - You might have heard about some of these types of Cost Functions being associated with a particular 
        ML algorithm, such as:
        -> Mean Square Error (MSE)/Mean Absolute Error (MAE) being associated with Single Variable Linear 
           Regression (SVLR) and Multiple Variable Linear Regression (MVLR)
        -> Binary Logistic Loss/Binary Cross-Entropy being associated with Binary Logistic Regression (BLR) 
           ML algorithm 
        -> Multi-Class/Categorical Logistic Loss / Multi-Class/Categorical Cross-Entropy or 
           Sparse Multi-Class/Categorical Cross-Entropy being associated with Multinominal Logistic 
           Regression (MLR) ML algorithm 
        -> Hinge Loss being associated with Support Vector Machines (SVM) ML algorithm

        These associations exist because of the compatible characteristics of the ML algorithm with
        the mathematical property of the Cost Function (mathematical equation).
