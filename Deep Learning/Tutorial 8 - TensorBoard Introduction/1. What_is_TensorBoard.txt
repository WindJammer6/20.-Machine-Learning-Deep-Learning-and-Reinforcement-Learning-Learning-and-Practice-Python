What is TensorBoard?
TensorBoard is a powerful visualization tool designed specifically for ML workflows. 
It provides insights into the training process of ML models, allowing developers to 
track and optimize the performance of their models more effectively. 

TensorBoard is often associated with TensorFlow, but it can be used with other ML 
frameworks as well (e.g. PyTorch, etc.).
