What is Deep Learning (DL)?
(artificial) Neural Networks is a powerful Machine Learning (ML) algorithm that can be used as any of 
the 4 ways/approaches of training a machine to be able to be capable of predicting outcomes and 
classifying information without human intervention (i.e. Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning,
Semi-supervised learning and Reinforcement learning). They are so powerful, such that there
is an entire field of study about (artificial) Neural Networks, particularly on 'deep' 
(artificial) Neural Networks, known as Deep Learning (DL).

Why is Deep Learning (DL) becoming so popular?
1. Data Growth - for example, businesses nowadays all around the world have access to alot of 
   data, many people post their content on social media

2. Hardware Advancements - advancements in hardware. In the past, CPUs and GPUs in computers are very slow
   (low computing power) and it takes hours for your computer to train a Neural Network. But now, your 
   CPUs and GPUs in computers are very fast (high computing power) and you can train a Neural Network in
   seconds

3. Python and Opensource Ecosystem - Python is a very simple programming language and anyone with some
   mathematical or statisics background can pick it up very quickly and start making (artificial) Neural 
   Networks. Additionally, the creation of PyTorch (by Facebook) and TensorFlow (by Google) frameworks, 
   makes it so much easier to build Neural Networks as well.

4. Cloud - Nowadays you can run more computationally expensive programming jobs (such as
   training a Neural Network) onto the Cloud, where they will run your programming job on another (more 
   powerful) computer elsewhere in the Cloud, allowing you to speed it up. It saves you time and money
   since you don't need to invest in better hardware on your computer to run computationally expensive 
   programming jobs (such as training a Neural Network). 

5. AI Boom - Big companies like Google have been moving towards being more AI-focused, causing many
   big companies to follow in their footsteps as well, and if youre not using AI you are sort of behind.
   This drove up the popularity of AI.

Why is a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) preferred over a Central Processing Unit (CPU) for Deep Learning?
GPU are originally developed for rendering graphics but is later adapted for general-purpose computing
due to their ability to perform thousands of simple calculations simultaneously.

GPU is preferred since it handles mathematical operations much faster and is specialised to do that, and
has thousands of coures optimized for parallel processing, which is what Neural Networks are all about. 
CPU is more general-purpose, and has fewer cores optimized for single-threaded performance, hence it
does not handle mathematical operations as quickly as GPUs.
